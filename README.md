## Overview

This is a website design made with the help of a design inspired by one of the [THEMESMID](https://www.templatemonster.com/authors/themesmid/#author-about) template [Faster-Multipurpose Responsive HTML Website](https://www.templatemonster.com/website-templates/faster-multipurpose-responsive-html-website-template-176905.html). This is done as part of my practice of designing and developing websites and all the contents and images are copied from the template. HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes of the website are entirely done myself. This is entirely done for the practice purpose and not for any commercial use.
